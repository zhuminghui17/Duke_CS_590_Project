In recent years, the use of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft has become increasingly popular, transforming the way people commute and navigate cities. As a result, the analysis of ride-sharing data has become an essential tool for policymakers, transportation planners, drivers, and business owners to make informed decisions about urban mobility.

The city of Chicago has been a hub for ride-sharing services, with millions of trips taken every year. By analyzing the data collected by ride-sharing companies operating in Chicago from 2018 to 2023, researchers and analysts can gain valuable insights into travel patterns, traffic congestion, and user behavior.

Such data can be used to inform transportation policies, including the allocation of resources to improve infrastructure such as roads, bridges, tunnels, and public transportation systems, and reducing traffic congestion. Additionally, businesses in the transportation and hospitality sectors can use this data to make strategic decisions about pricing, service offerings, and marketing strategies.

For drivers, the analysis of ride-sharing data can provide valuable insights into the demand for their services, optimal pick-up and drop-off locations, and pricing strategies. This information can help drivers maximize their earnings and improve their overall experience on the platform.

The target audience for this data analysis includes policymakers, urban planners, transportation officials, and business owners in Chicago and beyond. These stakeholders have a vested interest in understanding the dynamics of ride-sharing in the city, and how it affects urban mobility and economic growth. Therefore, the findings of this analysis could provide critical insights into improving transportation systems and fostering economic development in Chicago and other urban centers.
